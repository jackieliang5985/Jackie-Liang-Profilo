  'Geospatial-Emergency-Bus-Stop-Locator': `Top 5 project at BramHacks 2025. Python, React, and Django app that layers custom GeoJSON on Leaflet maps to highlight emergency bus stops inside selected census tracts, helping transit teams coordinate evacuations faster.`,
  
  'interview-pro': `Full-stack AI interview coach built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and SQLite. Streams speech-to-text transcription, runs OpenRouter-powered scoring across four metrics, and stores 100+ session transcripts so candidates can track improvement.`,

  'San-Francisco-Real-Estate-Application': `San Francisco real-estate recommendation tool written in Python. Cleans municipal datasets with Pandas/Numpy, geocodes any user address with Geopy, locates the closest property by Haversine distance, and surfaces comparable listings with Matplotlib visuals based on bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and price.`,
  
  'Cardiovascular-Prediction-Model': `A machine learning project using a 500k+ dataset of people with cardiovascular disease. Trained a decision tree model with 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% testing data, achieving 75% accuracy while avoiding overfitting.`,
  
  'Astro': `Astro Academy, built by Team Coolie, captured 2nd place at BramHacks 2025. It’s a gamified, AI-enhanced learning platform that helps students explore space science via interactive simulation modules covering exploration, earth systems, and live disaster scenarios.`,
  
  'SF-General-exploratory-Analysis': `Prototype analytics for the MyHomie Homes valuation engine built on top of the 600k-record San Francisco Assessor dataset. Includes heatmaps to detect highly correlated features (and prune them to reduce overfitting), experiments with similarity scoring across bedrooms/bathrooms/sqft/price, and early pricing models that evolved into the production system powering MyHomie Homes.`,
